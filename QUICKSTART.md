A: Edit files in v0 (or locally), push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys in ~1 minute.

**Q: What if something breaks?**  
A: With GitHub, you can rollback to any previous version instantly. No worries!

**Q: Do I need to know Git?**  
A: For first-time setup yes. After that, just `git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push`.
